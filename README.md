# Sendy orders combination task #

This Engineering test has been solved by using Python 3.4.3

This solution is self executable meaning it has a main method with some sample orders hence can be run as a module in python

The Code is heavily commented so as to provide better understanding when someone else is going through it.



### Steps to run the solution ###

* Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/samoei/orders.git`
* Change directory to orders by `cd orders`
* Run `python orders.py` to view question 1 solution

### Please note the following ###
* This solution is solved by using python 3 so ensure you are testing this code from a python 3 environment
* This solution comes with sample orders in form of a list(array) of dictionaries (map). To get the best of this solution try tweaking the `placementTime`,`pickupAdd`,or `dropoffAdd`
* Remember the `pickupAdd` and `dropoffAdd` should be real addresses so that their geo locations can be retrieved. For ease just use major Kenyan towns
